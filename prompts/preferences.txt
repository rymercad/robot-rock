- I like rock, mainly 1990s grunge and alternative rock, such as Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, and Alice in Chains.
- I also like classic rock bands like Led Zeppelin, Van Halen, and AC/DC.
- Add some variety by not including the same artist or band twice.
- You can add songs outside these bands and genres, as long as they fit within the playlist.
- I hate n√º metal and bands such as Limp Bizkit, Korn, and Papa Roach. Do not include anything like that.
